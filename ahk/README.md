F4 = Exit
F1 = Toggle everything
F2 = Toggle always aim


Pressing A and D keys at the same time will no longer make your character stop moving when the main toggle is enabled. This makes movement feel more snappy.

XButton2/forward mouse button = Gadget towards the mouse position, good for jumps and dashing
Left Shift = cancel aim and auto aim super, hold key to repeat taps
Space = cancel aiming and auto aim attack, hold key to repeat taps
T = spin (+wasd keys try to move in a direction while spinning WIP lol)

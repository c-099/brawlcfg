To use this you can either [https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey](install Autohotkey) and run the .ahk file 

or [https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey/releases/download/v2.0.21/AutoHotkey_2.0.21.zip](download the AutoHotkey .zip) and rename the exe file to 'brawlstars.exe' and it will automatically start the brawlstars.ahk script when you start it.

F4 = Exit
F1 = Toggle everything
F2 = Toggle always aim


Pressing A and D keys at the same time will no longer make your character stop moving when the main toggle is enabled. This makes movement feel more snappy.

XButton2/forward mouse button = Gadget towards the mouse position, good for jumps and dashing
Left Shift = cancel aim and auto aim super, hold key to repeat taps
Space = cancel aiming and auto aim attack, hold key to repeat taps
T = spin (+wasd keys try to move in a direction while spinning WIP)
